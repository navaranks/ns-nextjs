            The purpose of this class is not only to learn about chemistry, but
            to explore and be able explain the various of ideas that make up
            chemistry. We will accomplish this task by using the same
            mathematical techniques and technology used in the industry,
            developing skills necessary for successful data acquisition in a
            laboratory. of this class is to explain and explore the various
            ideas that make up chemistry. Just like in normal lab, there will be
            a lot of work done collaboratively. Working together is highly
            encouraged, however, cheating/plagiarism will not be tolerated. If
            you received help, give them credit. However, if you are suspected
            or found to be cheating, the cheating policy by the Dean of Students
            will be enforced.

            In order to ensure no class time is wasted, make sure to come
            prepared to class every day with all your required materials and
            completed homework ready to turn in. If your homework is not
            finished, is not stapled, and/or does not have your name, it is

                  School today is very different from how it was in the past,
                  allowing for easier communication between teachers, parents
                  and students. Ensuring the success of students is an equal
                  team effort. Therefore it is important that you also keep
                  track of what your child is doing in class to help keep them
                  focused. Some recommendations are:

                    <li>Please do not wait until the end of the semester to see how your child is doing. Check in with your child at least every two weeks to see how they are doing in the class.</li>
                    <li>You are welcome to contact me by email, phone or office hours. Please allow 24 hours for a response. If you have not heard from me in 24 hours, follow up emails are always appreciated.</li>

                  I do not expect you to fully master material on your first
                  try. We are going to learn together, make mistakes together,
                  and grow together. What I expect from everyone is dedication.
                  Mastery will not happen overnight. It is going to take time.
                  If you need extra help, you can rewatch the lecture videos,
                  create study groups with your peers or attend office hours.
                  Remember that I am here to help you and will do everything
                  that I can to provide plenty of opportunities to check for
                  understanding and correct any misconceptions.

                  You must have your homework ready to be turned in when you
                  arrive to class. Do not think you may spend 15 minutes or even
                  15 seconds looking for where you have put it, finishing one
                  question, stapling pages together or even writing your name on
                  it. Work is due when you arrive in the room. The same concept
                  applies to bringing the materials, calculators and tools that
                  are necessary for you to do your job, the job of being a
                  student. Remember that while you are in my course, my
                  objective is to prepare you for the real world and the
                  consequences you will face will be of the same level as those
                  in the real world. If you come without your tools, you cannot
                  work and hence will not be paid that day. You will not receive
                  credit for the work assigned or collected that day
