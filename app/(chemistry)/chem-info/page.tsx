            The purpose of this class is not only to learn about chemistry, but
            to explore and be able explain the various of ideas that make up
            chemistry. We will accomplish this task by using the same
            mathematical techniques and technology used in the industry,
            developing skills necessary for successful data acquisition in a
            laboratory. of this class is to explain and explore the various
            ideas that make up chemistry. Just like in normal lab, there will be
            a lot of work done collaboratively. Working together is highly
            encouraged, however, cheating/plagiarism will not be tolerated. If
            you received help, give them credit. However, if you are suspected
            or found to be cheating, the cheating policy by the Dean of Students
            will be enforced.

            In order to ensure no class time is wasted, make sure to come
            prepared to class every day with all your required materials and
            completed homework ready to turn in. If your homework is not
            finished, is not stapled, and/or does not have your name, it is
            incomplete. Our time together will be used to learn, not looking for
            homework. Below is a list of the required materials needed and
            expectations for this class...
